AutoPhaseNN 1, a physics-aware unsupervised deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns to solve the phase problem without ever being shown real space images of the sample amplitude or phase. By incorporating the physics of the X-ray scattering into the network design and training, AutoPhaseNN learns to predict both the amplitude and phase of the sample given the measured diffraction intensity alone.</description></item><item><title>Calorimeter surrogates</title><link>/docs/surrogates/calorimeter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/surrogates/calorimeter/</guid><description>Overview The Kaggle calorimeter challenge uses generative AI to produce a surrogate for the Monte Carlo calculation of a calorimeter response to an incident particle (ATLAS data at LHC calculated with GEANT4).

In the present paper we study the use of encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms as surrogates for steady-state diffusion solvers. The construction of such surrogates requires the selection of an appropriate task, network architecture, training set structure and size, loss function, and training algorithm hyperparameters.</description></item><item><title>Cosmoflow</title><link>/docs/surrogates/cosmoflow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/surrogates/cosmoflow/</guid><description>Metadata Model cosmoflow.json

Overview This application is based on the original CosmoFlow paper presented at SC18 and continued by the ExaLearn project, and adopted as a benchmark in the MLPerf HPC suite. It involves training a 3D convolutional neural network on N-body cosmology simulation data to predict physical parameters of the universe. The reference implementation for MLPerf HPC v0.5 CosmoFlow uses TensorFlow with the Keras API and Horovod for data-parallel distributed training.</description></item><item><title>Fully ionized plasma fluid model closures</title><link>/docs/surrogates/ionized-plasma/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/surrogates/ionized-plasma/</guid><description>Fully ionized plasma fluid model closures (Argonne):1 The closure problem in fluid modeling is a well-known challenge to modelers aiming to accurately describe their system of interest. Analytic formulations in a wide range of regimes exist but a practical, generalized fluid closure for magnetized plasmas remains an elusive goal. There are scenarios where complex physics prevents a simple closure being assumed, and the question as to what closure to employ has a non-trivial answer.</description></item><item><title>Ions in nanoconfinement</title><link>/docs/surrogates/ions-in-nanoconfinement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/surrogates/ions-in-nanoconfinement/</guid><description>Metadata Model nanoconfinement.json

Although many open-source and commercial packages exist for docking, AI approaches can be equally powerful (and computationally more efficient) for docking studies 2. Utilizing advances in control from reinforcement learning (RL), Argonne researchers trained an agent to drive the docking of a rigid ligand into a flexible protein pocket. The RL agent treats the ligand as a rigid body to which it can move through affine transformations along the protein.</description></item><item><title>miniWeatherML</title><link>/docs/surrogates/miniweatherml/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/surrogates/miniweatherml/</guid><description>Metadata Model miniWeatherML.json

We build upon the Open Surrogate Model Inference (OSMI) Benchmark, a distributed inference benchmark for analyzing the performance of machine-learned surrogate models developed by Wes Brewer et. Al. We focus on analyzing distributed machine-learning systems, via machine-learned surrogate models, across varied hardware environments. By deploying the OSMI Benchmark on platforms like Rivanna HPC, WSL, and Ubuntu, we offer a comprehensive study of system performance under different configurations.</description></item><item><title>Particle dynamics</title><link>/docs/surrogates/particle-dynamics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/surrogates/particle-dynamics/</guid><description>Recurrent Neural Nets as a Particle Dynamics Integrator
The second IU initial application shows a rather different type of surrogate and illustrates an SBI goal to collect benchmarks covering a range of surrogate designs. Molecular dynamics simulations rely on numerical integrators such as Verlet to solve Newton&amp;rsquo;s equations of motion. Using a sufficiently small time step to avoid discretization errors, Verlet integrators generate a trajectory of particle positions as solutions to the equations of motions.</description></item><item><title>Performance Surrogate</title><link>/docs/surrogates/performance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/surrogates/performance/</guid><description>Overview Please contact Piotre
