including data, code, and all relevant collateral artifacts the science and
engineering community needs to use and reuse these data sets and surrogates.</p></div><p>Like nearly every field of science and engineering today,
Computational Science using High Performance Computing (HPC) is being
transformed by the ongoing revolution in Artificial Intelligence (AI),
especially by the use of data-driven Deep Neural Network (DNN)
techniques. In particular, DNN surrogate models <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>, are
being used to replace either part or all of traditional large-scale
HPC simulations, achieving remarkable performance improvements (e.g.,
several orders of magnitude) in the process <sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup>
<sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup>. Having been trained on data produced by actual runs of a given
HPC simulation, such a surrogate can imitate, with high fidelity, part
or all of that simulation, producing the same outcomes for a given set
of inputs, but at far less cost in time and energy.</p><img src=/images/sbi-fair-arch.png><p>Figure 1. The Surrogate Benchmark Initiative (SBI)and its components</p><p>As a world leader in HPC for many decades, the Department of Energy
will undoubtedly seek to exploit the power of such AI-driven
surrogates, especially because of the end of Dennard scaling and
Moore’s law. However, at present, there are no accepted benchmarks for
such surrogates, and so no way to measure progress or inform the
codesign of new HPC systems to support their use. The Surrogate
Benchmark Initiative (SBI) project proposed below aims to address this
fundamental problem by creating a community repository and FAIR data
ecosystem for HPC application surrogate benchmarks, including data,
code, and all relevant collateral artifacts the science and
engineering community needs to use and reuse these data sets and
surrogates.</p><p>To make “&mldr; scientific data publicly available to the AI community so
that algorithms, tools, and techniques work for science,” we propose a
community-driven, FAIR benchmarking activity that will 1) support AI
research into different attractive approaches and 2) provide exemplars
with reference implementations that will enable surrogates to be
extended across a wide range of scientific fields, while encompassing
the many different aspects of simulation where surrogates are
useful. The key components of the project are depicted in Figure 1
above.</p><p>By collaborating with the major industry organization in this area -
MLPerf and mirroring their process as much as possible, we will both
increase the value of and obtain industry involvement in the SBI
benchmarks. MLPerf has over 80 institutional members (mainly from
industry) and strong existing involvement of the Department of Energy
laboratories through the HPC working group inside MLPerf, which is now
being extended with a science data working group. To ensure that FAIR
principles are rigorously followed, we will initially set up data and
model repositories outside MLPerf. Containers and service
specifications such as OpenAPI will be systematically used. We will
then explore how much can be usefully and FAIRly integrated with
MLPerf, as our repositories have related but different goals and
constraints from MLPerf. To learn how to effectively and efficiently
set up FAIR repositories, we will start with (updates of) existing
surrogates from team members.</p><p>Simultaneously, we will reach out to the community of experienced
users building on our recent review <sup id=fnref1:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> and recent papers <sup id=fnref1:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup>, <sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup>,
<sup id=fnref:10><a href=#fn:10 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>10</a></sup>. The outreach will use permanent SBI working groups with the
Zoom/Meet/Teams/BlueJeans/Slack/cloud support that is now common and
these will link to appropriate MLPerf groups. Online tutorials will be
constructed based on the data and AI models that will support the
broad understanding of the use and design of surrogates. These
tutorials will also be designed so that they can help other
stakeholders that need to understand the value of and requirements for
surrogates; this includes the systems software/middleware and hardware
architecture communities. The tutorials will be an early goal so we
can reach out to domain scientists with important simulation codes but
so far little or unsophisticated surrogate use.</p><p>A key aspect of SBI will be the development of an efficient generic
surrogate architecture and accompanying middleware that will support
the derivation and use of surrogates across many fields. Another
specific activity will be the support of the use of benchmarks in the
uncertainty quantification of the surrogate estimates. Thirdly there
will be important studies of the amount of training data needed to get
reliable surrogates for a given accuracy choice. We have already
developed an effective performance model for surrogates but this needs
extension as deeper uses of surrogates become understood and populated
in our repositories.</p><p>We will link the repositories to important hardware systems including
major DoE and NSF environments, commercial high-performance clouds,
and available novel hardware. The study of the emerging AI systems
space is an important goal of our project as our benchmarks stress
both AI and simulation performance and so may not give the same
conclusions as purely AI-focused benchmarks. Although we initially
stress simulation surrogates, we will also consider AI surrogates for
big data computations.</p><p>We intend that our repositories will generate active research from
both the participants in our project and the broad community of AI and
domain scientists. The FAIR ease of use, tutorials, and links to
relevant execution platforms will be important. To initiate and foster
strong virtual community support we will also use hackathons, Meetups,
journal special issues, conference tutorials, and exhibits to nurture
the outside use of our resources. As well as advancing research, which
is our focus, we expect the project will be valuable for education and
training. The project will explicitly fund staff to make sure that
non-project users are properly supported and that our use of FAIR
principles is effective.</p><h2 id=refernces>Refernces</h2><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Geoffrey Fox, Shantenu Jha, “Understanding ML driven HPC:

ABSTRACT={In many mechanistic medical, biological, physical, and engineered spatiotemporal dynamic models the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), especially for diffusion, fluid flow and mechanical relaxation, can make simulations impractically slow. Biological models of tissues and organs often require the simultaneous calculation of the spatial variation of concentration of dozens of diffusing chemical species. One clinical example where rapid calculation of a diffusing field is of use is the estimation of oxygen gradients in the retina, based on imaging of the retinal vasculature, to guide surgical interventions in diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, the ability to predict blood perfusion and oxygenation may one day guide clinical interventions in diverse settings, i.e., from stent placement in treating heart disease to BOLD fMRI interpretation in evaluating cognitive function (Xie et al., &lt;xref ref-type=&#34;bibr&#34; rid=&#34;B40&#34;&gt;2019&lt;/xref&gt;; Lee et al., &lt;xref ref-type=&#34;bibr&#34; rid=&#34;B23&#34;&gt;2020&lt;/xref&gt;). Since the quasi-steady-state solutions required for fast-diffusing chemical species like oxygen are particularly computationally costly, we consider the use of a neural network to provide an approximate solution to the steady-state diffusion equation. Machine learning surrogates, neural networks trained to provide approximate solutions to such complicated numerical problems, can often provide speed-ups of several orders of magnitude compared to direct calculation. Surrogates of PDEs could enable use of larger and more detailed models than are possible with direct calculation and can make including such simulations in real-time or near-real time workflows practical. Creating a surrogate requires running the direct calculation tens of thousands of times to generate training data and then training the neural network, both of which are computationally expensive. Often the practical applications of such models require thousands to millions of replica simulations, for example for parameter identification and uncertainty quantification, each of which gains speed from surrogate use and rapidly recovers the up-front costs of surrogate generation. We use a Convolutional Neural Network to approximate the stationary solution to the diffusion equation in the case of two equal-diameter, circular, constant-value sources located at random positions in a two-dimensional square domain with absorbing boundary conditions. Such a configuration caricatures the chemical concentration field of a fast-diffusing species like oxygen in a tissue with two parallel blood vessels in a cross section perpendicular to the two blood vessels. To improve convergence during training, we apply a training approach that uses roll-back to reject stochastic changes to the network that increase the loss function. The trained neural network approximation is about 1000 times faster than the direct calculation for individual replicas. Because different applications will have different criteria for acceptable approximation accuracy, we discuss a variety of loss functions and accuracy estimators that can help select the best network for a particular application. We briefly discuss some of the issues we encountered with overfitting, mismapping of the field values and the geometrical conditions that lead to large absolute and relative errors in the approximate solution.}

the performance of distributed Machine Learning systems. We build upon
the Open Surrogate Model Inference (OSMI) Benchmark, a distributed
inference benchmark for analyzing the performance of machine-learned
surrogate models developed by Wes Brewer et. Al. We focus on analyzing
distributed machine-learning systems, via machine-learned surrogate
models, across varied hardware environments. By deploying the OSMI
Benchmark on platforms like Rivanna HPC, WSL, and Ubuntu, we offer a
comprehensive study of system performance under different
configurations. The paper presents insights into optimizing
distributed machine learning systems, enhancing their scalability and
efficiency. We also develope a framework for automating the OSMI
benchmark.</p><h2 id=introdcution>Introdcution</h2><p>With the proliferation of machine learning as a tool for science, the
need for efficient and scalable systems is paramount. This paper
explores the Open Surrogate Model Inference (OSMI) Benchmark, a tool
for testing the performance of machine-learning systems via
machine-learned surrogate models. The OSMI Benchmark, originally
created by Wes Brewer and colleagues, serves to evaluate various
configurations and their impact on system performance.</p><p>Our research pivots around the deployment and analysis of the OSMI
Benchmark across various hardware platforms, including the
high-performance computing (HPC) system Rivanna, Windows Subsystem for
Linux (WSL), and Ubuntu environments.</p><p>In each experiment, there are a variable number of TensorFlow model
server instances, overseen by a HAProxy load balancer that distributes
inference requests among the servers. Each server instance operates on
a dedicated GPU, choosing between the V100 or A100 GPUs available on
Rivanna. This setup mirrors real-world scenarios where load balancing
is crucial for system efficiency.</p><p>On the client side, we initiate a variable number of concurrent
clients executing the OSMI benchmark to simulate different levels of
system load and analyze the corresponding inference throughput.</p><p>On top of the original OSMI-Bench, we implemented an object-oriented
interface in Python for running experiments with ease, streamlining
the process of benchmarking and analysis. The experiments rely on
custom-built images based on NVIDIA&rsquo;s tensorflow image. The code works
on several hardwares, assuming the proper images are built.</p><p>Additionally, We develop a script for launching simultaneous
experiments with permutations of pre-defined parameters with Cloudmesh
Experiment-Executor. The Experiment Executor is a tool that automates
the generation and execution of experiment variations with different
parameters. This automation is crucial for conducting tests across a
spectrum of scenarios.</p><p>Finally, we analyze the inference throughput and total time for each
experiment. By graphing and examining these results, we draw critical
insights into the performance dynamics of distributed machine learning
systems.</p><p>In summary, a comprehensive examination of the OSMI Benchmark in
diverse distributed ML systems is provided. We aim to contribute to
the optimization of these systems, by providing a framework for
finding the best performant system configuration for a given use
case. Our findings pave the way for more efficient and scalable
distributed computing environments.</p><p><sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup><sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ol start=2021><li><a href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9652868>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9652868</a>.

problem in fluid modeling is a well-known challenge to modelers aiming
to accurately describe their system of interest. Analytic formulations
in a wide range of regimes exist but a practical, generalized fluid
closure for magnetized plasmas remains an elusive goal. There are
scenarios where complex physics prevents a simple closure being
assumed, and the question as to what closure to employ has a
non-trivial answer. In a proof-of-concept study, Argonne researchers
turned to machine learning to try to construct surrogate closure
models that map the known macroscopic variables in a fluid model to
the higher-order moments that must be closed. In their study, the
researchers considered three closures: Braginskii, Hammett-Perkins,
and Guo-Tang; for each of them, they tried three types of ANNs:
locally connected, convolutional, and fully connected. Applying a
physics-informed machine learning approach, they found that there is a
benefit to tailoring a specific network architecture informed by the
physics of the plasma regime each closure is designed for, rather than
carelessly applying an unnecessarily complex general network
architecture. will choose one of the surrogates and bring it up an
early example for SBI with reference implementation and tutorial

(CNN) that learns to solve the phase problem without ever being shown real space
images of the sample amplitude or phase. By incorporating the physics of the
X-ray scattering into the network design and training, AutoPhaseNN learns to
predict both the amplitude and phase of the sample given the measured
diffraction intensity alone. Additionally, unlike previous deep learning models,
AutoPhaseNN does not need the ground truth images of sample’s amplitude and
phase at any point, either in training or in deployment. Once trained, the
physical model is discarded and only the CNN portion is needed which has learned
the data inversion from reciprocal space to real space and is ~100 times faster
than the iterative phase retrieval with comparable image quality. Furthermore,
we show that by using AutoPhaseNN’s prediction as the learned prior to iterative
phase retrieval, we can achieve consistently higher image quality, than neural
network prediction alone, at 10 times faster speed than iterative phase
retrieval alone.</p><figure class="card rounded p-2 td-post-card mb-4 mt-4" style=max-width:910px><img class=card-img-top src=/docs/surogates/autophasenn/autophasenn1_huf90a121ae4129385ddbbadbc4dfa22cd_382578_900x0_resize_catmullrom_3.png width=900 height=429><figcaption class="card-body px-0 pt-2 pb-0"><p class=card-text>Fig. 1: Schematic of the neural network structure of AutoPhaseNN model during training.
a) The model consists of a 3D CNN and the X-ray scattering forward model. The 3D
CNN is implemented with a convolutional auto-encoder and two deconvolutional
decoders using the convolutional, maximum pooling, upsampling and zero padding
layers. The physical knowledge is enforced via the Sigmoid and Tanh activation
functions in the final layers. b The X-ray scattering forward model includes the
numerical modeling of diffraction and the image shape constraints. It takes the
amplitude and phase from the 3D CNN output to form the complex image. Then the
estimated diffraction pattern is obtained from the FT of the current estimation
of the real space image.

We are trying to understand how deep learning can work for problems with a large range of input or output values. Examples could be covid, flu counts, images with a wide range of illumination, finding surrogate solutions where function values often range over several orders of magnitude, and one is interested in both large and small values. This range of values is seen over spatial values (images) or time values (time series)</p><p>However, this doesn&rsquo;t seem to work properly in deep learning, where the activation value is 1. The weights cannot adjust to different sizes of input values, so one cannot see the nonlinearity of activation in values over the full range.

Today&rsquo;s discussion focussed on I/O and included a talk by Baixi which as always was very informative. I/O is a major bottleneck alleviated by caching in either SSD and/or CPU memory. There is a plan for a Parallel I/O and hdf5 paper at SC22. The Hoefler paper at SC21 <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458817.3476181>Clairvoyant prefetching for distributed machine learning I/O | Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis</a> has a simulator that ANL used in this analysis. Shuffling is major difficulty as requires access to all the data. There is a fast local version but it is not as good an algorithm as the usual global shuffle. Currently, dataset is 22 GB but it can increase. \</p><p><strong>Indiana</strong></p><p>Vikram reported that his surrogate was ready to deploy and that he has received a Summit allocation to support its training. He had met with Shantenu. He sent Cade Brown a couple of links to a repository that hosts their ML surrogate model and the simulation code used to generate datasets to train and test this model. Hopefully, this surrogate can serve as a test model for the system he is building.</p><p><a href=https://github.com/softmaterialslab/nanoconfinement-md/tree/master/python>https://github.com/softmaterialslab/nanoconfinement-md/tree/master/python</a></p><p><a href=https://github.com/softmaterialslab/nanoconfinement-md/>https://github.com/softmaterialslab/nanoconfinement-md/</a></p><p>You can see the surrogate in action, by launching the tool:</p><p><a href=https://nanohub.org/tools/nanoconfinement/>https://nanohub.org/tools/nanoconfinement/</a></p><p><strong>Virginia</strong></p><p>Progress continues with surrogate for discussion solver.

There was a discussion between Piotr and Gregor about that indicated that the YAML format is not sufficient to encode the surrogate and the hardware used for it. An alternative was discussed where one encodes endpoints in the YAML and these endpoints have the detailed metadata/Schema. This is natural in examples that use PyTorch or Tensorflow which could have customized sub-ontologies. Gregor suggested circulating an example to identify if YAML would be nevertheless good enough. The performance surrogate is running on Summit.</p><p><strong>Argonne</strong></p><p>Argonne described the continued work on understanding the performance of distributed training already discussed in the last three meetings with the 2 models, Horovod and the Mirrored Strategy, for ptychoNN surrogate.

We design soft labels for the simulation outputs by incorporating the uncertainties in the estimated average output quantities and introduce a modified loss function that leverages these soft labels during training to significantly reduce the surrogate prediction error for input systems in the unseen test data. The approach is illustrated with the design of a surrogate for molecular dynamics simulations of confined electrolytes to predict the complex relationship between the input electrolyte attributes and the output ionic structure. The surrogate predictions for the ionic density profiles show excellent agreement with the ground truth results produced using molecular dynamics simulations.”</p><p><strong>Rutgers</strong></p><ul><li>Collaboration with Vikram has started</li><li>Classification of surrogates introduced 6 classes and analyzed many new papers</li><li>Gordon Bell submission involved Caltech + DOE Labs + San Diego and used surrogates at multiple levels &ndash; it studied how to balance effort between them.
