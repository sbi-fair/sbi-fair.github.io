Comment on Surrogates produced by generative methods versus those that map particular inputs to particular outputs. In examples like experimental physics apparatus simulations, you only need output and not input. Methods need to sample output data space correctly. Geoffrey also described earlier experiences using second-order methods and least squares/maximum likelihood optimizations for physics data analysis.</description></item><item><title>Meeting Notes 04-03-2023</title><link>/docs/notes/2023-04-03/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/notes/2023-04-03/</guid><description>Minutes of SBI-FAIR April 3 2023, Meeting
