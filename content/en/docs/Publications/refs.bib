  ABSTRACT =	 {In many mechanistic medical, biological, physical,
                  and engineered spatiotemporal dynamic models the
                  numerical solution of partial differential equations
                  (PDEs), especially for diffusion, fluid flow and
                  mechanical relaxation, can make simulations
                  impractically slow. Biological models of tissues and
                  organs often require the simultaneous calculation of
                  the spatial variation of concentration of dozens of
                  diffusing chemical species. One clinical example
                  where rapid calculation of a diffusing field is of
                  use is the estimation of oxygen gradients in the
                  retina, based on imaging of the retinal vasculature,
                  to guide surgical interventions in diabetic
                  retinopathy. Furthermore, the ability to predict
                  blood perfusion and oxygenation may one day guide
                  clinical interventions in diverse settings, i.e.,
                  from stent placement in treating heart disease to
                  BOLD fMRI interpretation in evaluating cognitive
                  function (Xie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr"
                  rid="B40">2019</xref>; Lee et al., <xref
                  ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2020</xref>). Since the
                  quasi-steady-state solutions required for
                  fast-diffusing chemical species like oxygen are
                  particularly computationally costly, we consider the
                  use of a neural network to provide an approximate
                  solution to the steady-state diffusion
                  equation. Machine learning surrogates, neural
                  networks trained to provide approximate solutions to
                  such complicated numerical problems, can often
                  provide speed-ups of several orders of magnitude
                  compared to direct calculation. Surrogates of PDEs
                  could enable use of larger and more detailed models
                  than are possible with direct calculation and can
                  make including such simulations in real-time or
                  near-real time workflows practical. Creating a
                  surrogate requires running the direct calculation
                  tens of thousands of times to generate training data
                  and then training the neural network, both of which
                  are computationally expensive. Often the practical
                  applications of such models require thousands to
                  millions of replica simulations, for example for
                  parameter identification and uncertainty
                  quantification, each of which gains speed from
                  surrogate use and rapidly recovers the up-front
                  costs of surrogate generation. We use a
                  Convolutional Neural Network to approximate the
                  stationary solution to the diffusion equation in the
                  case of two equal-diameter, circular, constant-value
                  sources located at random positions in a
                  two-dimensional square domain with absorbing
                  boundary conditions. Such a configuration
                  caricatures the chemical concentration field of a
                  fast-diffusing species like oxygen in a tissue with
                  two parallel blood vessels in a cross section
                  perpendicular to the two blood vessels. To improve
                  convergence during training, we apply a training
                  approach that uses roll-back to reject stochastic
                  changes to the network that increase the loss
                  function. The trained neural network approximation
                  is about 1000 times faster than the direct
                  calculation for individual replicas. Because
                  different applications will have different criteria
                  for acceptable approximation accuracy, we discuss a
                  variety of loss functions and accuracy estimators
                  that can help select the best network for a
                  particular application. We briefly discuss some of
                  the issues we encountered with overfitting,
                  mismapping of the field values and the geometrical
                  conditions that lead to large absolute and relative
                  errors in the approximate solution.}

  annote =	 {Over the last several years, the computation
                  landscape for conducting data analytics has
                  completely changed. While in the past, a lot of the
                  activities have been undertaken in isolation by
                  companies, and research institutions, today's
                  infrastructure constitutes a wealth of analytics
                  services offered by a variety of providers that
                  offer opportunities for reuse, interactions while
                  leveraging service collaboration, and service
                  cooperation. In this talk, we project our vision to
                  develop an analytics services framework to integrate
                  reusable hybrid multi-services across different
                  cloud infrastructure and service providers as well
                  as on-premise infrastructure and services. It
                  includes (a) analytics services that explicitly
                  target the intersection of hybrid multi-provider
                  analytics services, (b) the integration of sensor
                  networks into the service data, (c) the integration
                  of advanced modelling services as part of analytical
                  tasks such as earthquake prediction, and (d) the
                  coordination of these services. We showcase how our
                  vision can integrate leveraging service composition
                  with cooperation and competition analytics
                  services. We demonstrate the activities while
                  utilizing benchmark analytics services as used by
                  the MLCommons science benchmark working group.},
