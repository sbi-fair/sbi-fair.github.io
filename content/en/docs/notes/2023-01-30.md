**January 2 2023:**

**Present: **Deborah Penchoff, Shantenu Jha, Geoffrey Fox, Piotr Luszczek, Gregor von Laszewski 

We discussed producing a simple summary (roughly one slide per institution) describing the status and plans for the project. Virginia, UTK, and Rutgers made a draft which will be expanded before our January 30 meeting with Margaret. These should mention inter-institution collaborations. We continued on January 9

**January 9 2023:**

**Present:  **Geoffrey Fox, Kamil Iskra, Xiaodong Yu, Baixi Sun. Vikram Jadhao, Gregor von Laszewski

Based on the earlier meeting, Argonne and Indiana produced summary pages which we iterated to include collaborations to deposit surrogates in the repository.

**January 30, 2023:**

**Present:** not recorded, but all institutions represented

We gave our presentation  and followed with a discussion with Margaret. She noted recent DOE calls with useful links
