**Minutes of SBI-FAIR July 31 2023, Meeting**



* Monday, August 28, 2023, [https://virginia.zoom.us/my/gc.fox](https://virginia.zoom.us/my/gc.fox) 
* Monday, September 25, 2023, [https://virginia.zoom.us/my/gc.fox](https://virginia.zoom.us/my/gc.fox) 

**Present:** Geoffrey Fox, Gregor von Laszewski,  Przemek Porebski, Kamil Iskra, Xiaodong Yu, Baixi Sun. Piotr Luszczek, Shantenu Jha

**Apologies:** Vikram Jadhao, 

**Virginia**



* Geoffrey presented the Virginia Update [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/132erkV49Lgd0ZFx-AtNWJPRwTrxc480m-rU6jmvMmYA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/132erkV49Lgd0ZFx-AtNWJPRwTrxc480m-rU6jmvMmYA/edit?usp=sharing), which also included Indiana (see below) 
* Good progress with Argonne Surrogates
    * We have added PtychoNN to SABATH, and we have run AutoPhaseNN on Rivanna
* We reviewed other surrogates from Virginia including OSMIBench and a new Calorimeter simulation
* We are working well with Tennessee on SABATH
* Gregor finished with a little study on use of Rivanna -- the Virginia Supercomputer

**Indiana**



* Vikram is still traveling in India and was not able to join today's meeting. He shared by email the following updates.These are included in Virginia Presentation
* the nanoconfinement surrogate repository is updated with the latest results from the sample size study published in JCTC, [Probing Accuracy-Speedup Tradeoff in Machine Learning Surrogates for Molecular Dynamics Simulations | Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c01282) 
    * [https://github.com/softmaterialslab/nanoconfinement-md/tree/master/python/surrogate_samplesize](https://github.com/softmaterialslab/nanoconfinement-md/tree/master/python/surrogate_samplesize)  
    * Coordinate with Fanbo Sun who is leading the development of this surrogate and conducted the sample size study that I have shared in our meetings.
* Working on preparing the dataset for the follow-up study to JCTC
* literature review: if folks are interested, the special issue on machine learning for molecular simulation in JCTC has many interesting papers (including surrogates): [Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation | Vol 19, No 14](https://pubs.acs.org/toc/jctcce/19/14) 

**Argonne**



* Argonne’s funds have essentially finished 
* Xiaodong Yu is moving to Stevens
* New compression study  comparing methods that are error bounded or nott -- their performance differs by a factor of 4-6
* Baixi gave an update presentation  SSO: A Highly Scalable Second-order Optimization Framework ffor Deep Neural Networks via Communication Reduction
* Quantized Stochastic Gradient Descent QSGD Non error bounded
* Model accuracy versus compression tradeoff
* Unable to utilize error-feedback due to GPU memory being filled by large models and large batch size.
* Looked at different rounding methods
    * Stochastic rounding preserves direction better as not so many zeros
* Revised our I/O paper i.e., SOLAR based on the reviews, submitting to ppopp’24 with new experiments and better writeup

**Rutgers**



* The surrogate survey paper is making good progress with DeepDriveMD other motifs.
* Andre Merzy is working on associated Miniapps (surrogates)
* Will work with MLCommons in October

**Tennessee**



* Piotr presented his groups work [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ep9zxdv25I3MJmPt5YcJi32SHu5BAF4J/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ep9zxdv25I3MJmPt5YcJi32SHu5BAF4J/view?usp=sharing) 
* MiniWeatherML running with MPI and with or without CUDA. 
    * No external dataset is required
* SABATH making good progress in collaboration with Virginia
* They are working on Cosmoflow
* Piotr noted that those sites that are continuing with the project will need to submit a project report very soon. Geoffrey shared his project report to allow a common story
