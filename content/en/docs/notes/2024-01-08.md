* Shantenu described the background to the PI meeting for ASCR in February that was modeled on successful SCIDAC-wide meetings. It is not clear if sessions will be plenary or organized around Program manager portfolios.
* Virginia  started a list of surrogates that would help prepare any poster necessary 
* [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LonfbydMlQyLBv5vh8tjATv9BxdN7GmjuU8RFyuK5aw/edit#slide=id.g2acfd0f37ff_1_151](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LonfbydMlQyLBv5vh8tjATv9BxdN7GmjuU8RFyuK5aw/edit#slide=id.g2acfd0f37ff_1_151)  
* Argonne would add work on I/O, compression, and second-order methods. 
* Rutgers has surrogates to list, plus work on effective performance and their taxonomy of surrogate types. 
* Indiana was not available due to travel, but has work on data dependence and surrogates for sustainability (a new paper). 
* Tennessee has two surrogates, MiniWeatherML and Performance. Also has SABATH
* We did not set a next meeting until the PI meeting was clearer.
* Later email from DOE set the poster deadline as January 29.
