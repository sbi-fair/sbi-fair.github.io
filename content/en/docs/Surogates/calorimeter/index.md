  We explore the relationship between certain network configurations and the performance of distributed Machine
  Learning systems. We build upon the Open Surrogate Model Inference (OSMI) Benchmark, a distributed inference
  benchmark for analyzing the performance of machine-learned surrogate models

## Overview

This surrogate set is based on a Workshop CaloChalange, May 30-31, 2023, Rome

The workshop is organised to discuss the results of the calochallenge, this year's ML competition in high energy physics focussing on fast calorimeter simulation using generative models.

Every contributor will have the opportunity to present the method developed. Plenty of time will be devoted to discussions about the benefits and limitations of the different approaches.
