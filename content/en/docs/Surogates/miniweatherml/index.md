## Overview

MiniWeatherML is a playground for learning and developing Machine Learning (ML) surrogate models and workflows. It is based on a simplified weather model simulating flows such as supercells that are realistic enough to be challenging and simple enough for rapid prototyping in:

* Data generation and curation
* Machine Learning model training
* ML model deployment and analysis
* End-to-end workflows
