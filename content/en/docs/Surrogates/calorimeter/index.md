## Overview

The Kaggle calorimeter challenge [^1] uses generative AI to produce a surrogate for the Monte Carlo calculation of a calorimeter response to an incident particle (ATLAS data at LHC calculated with GEANT4). Variational Auto Encoders, GANs, Normalizing Flows, and Diffusion Models. We also have a surrogate using a Quantum Computer (DWAVE) annealer to generate random samples. We have identified four different surrogates that are available openly from Kaggle and later submissions.
