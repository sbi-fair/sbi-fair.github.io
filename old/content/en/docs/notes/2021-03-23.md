The 4 sites all gave updates with presentations listed above.

**Indiana** largely discussed work with MLCommons Science research working group



* Benchmark collection which will eventually include surrogates
* Benchmark Technology and FAIR metadata

**Argonne** presented substantial progress with



* The hiring of a new postdoc Xiaodong Yu with substantial experience
* Identification of several surrogates including those that don’t work e.g. give insufficient accuracy
* Use of ThetaGPU

**Tennessee **reported substantial progress with



* Examination of MLFlow and its metadata which support many storage formats but are missing FAIR features
* ONNX Open Neural Network Exchange which currently has no science or surrogate examples
* The N to N issues of matching many inputs to many outputs’
* Performance surrogate model for Autotuning work in progress

**Rutgers** (no presentation) discussed two activities



* Effective performance where a new student will join.
* Surrogates corresponding to two Gordon Bell prize winners at SC20 extending from Rutgers work with Argonne (autoencoders for collective coordinates to move through phase space quickly) to the other winner from Princeton where AI learned the complex potential.

**Action Items**

* We agreed to set the next meeting for 1-2 pm Eastern April 19 2021 at the usual zoom [https://iu.zoom.us/j/2301429329](https://iu.zoom.us/j/2301429329) 
* We agreed to enhance the web site with updated (after proposal) information. Please send your GitHub ID’s to Gregor [laszewski@gmail.com](mailto:laszewski@gmail.com)  so he can enable to directly edit web site
* Shantenu agreed to coordinate a surrogate working group after 4 weeks
* Piotr agreed to coordinate cross-institution FAIR activities including issues of MLCommons [metadata](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17RH-wAlEpiU5dcgKB-7kg5Z_zQzBOpfR?usp=sharing) and Christine Kirkpatrick’s [work](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15iQTE99xAUIPNe9bIY_l8Xsv2TVLyqoR/view?usp=sharing)
* Argonne will investigate Yu giving a short presentation
