**Argonne Presentation**

Xiaodong Yu’s described 3 surrogates being developed at Argonne

**Application 1** **PtychoNN: Ptychographic Imaging Reconstruction phase reconstruction **

Here the challenge is to determine phases from Xray scattering data with [paper](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0013065). The surrogate is being extended to run using Horovod on the multi-GPU ThetaGPU system. 

**Application 2: Geophysical Forecasting**

This involves LSTM forecast models combined with a neural architecture search NAS using deephyper in original[ paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3433701.3433711) which ran on Theta without GPUs.

**Application 3:** **Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation**

This is multiscale modeling of SARS-CoV-2 in the CANDLE project which received the 2020 ACM Gordon Bell Special Prize for High Performance Computing-Based COVID-19 Research.

Shantenu Jha was a co-author on their [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.19.390187v1) “AI-Driven Multiscale Simulations Illuminate Mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Dynamics”.

**Other Business** We discussed adding material to the **website**.

**Annual Report**

We just received the request from DOE for an annual report abstracted below, We could discuss (unfortunately it is due before our next meeting) a common text that we could use as part of each report. 

The Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) within the Department of Energy Office of Science requests that you submit a Progress Report for the award listed below. To create and submit the Progress Report, please use the DOE Office of Science [Portfolio Analysis and Management System (PAMS)](https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov/webPAMSEPSExternal/Interface/Common/AccessControl/login.aspx).

**Task:** Submit Progress Report ([Link](https://pamspublic.science.energy.gov/webPAMSExternal/Interface/Tasks/AwardeeReport/AwardeeReportList.aspx?TaskTypeCode=12))

**Due Date:** 06/24/2021 5:00 PM ET

**Reporting Period:** 09/23/2020 - 09/22/2021

**Next Meeting**

Our meetings are 1 pm Eastern on the 4th Monday of each month

This implies Monday, June 28, 1 pm at zoom [https://iu.zoom.us/j/2301429329](https://iu.zoom.us/j/2301429329) 

In the June meeting, Shantenu Jha will lead a discussion of surrogates.
